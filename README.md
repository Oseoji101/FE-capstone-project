This is a capstone project in partial fulfillment for the complettion of my training in ALX frontend software development course.
My goal is to design and implement a Movie Database application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (with optional Tailwind CSS). The application will allow users to search for movies and view detailed information about them, using a public movie API.

This project will help me practice integrating external APIs, handling user input, managing state in a dynamic application, and creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The project will simulate a real-world development environment, providing valuable experience in frontend web development and deployment.

Functional Requirements:
Fetch Movie Data:

Use a public movie API like the OMDB API to fetch movie data based on user search queries.
Display a list of movies matching the search criteria, showing key information such as:
Movie Poster: A thumbnail image of the movie poster.
Title: The title of the movie.
Release Date: The year the movie was released.
Movie Details View:

When a user clicks on a movie from the list, display a detailed view with additional information, including:
Plot Summary: A brief description of the movie plot.
Cast: Main actors and their roles.
Ratings: Ratings from different sources (e.g., IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes).
Genre: Categories the movie belongs to (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).
Search Functionality:

Implement a search bar that allows users to type in a movie name and retrieve relevant search results.
Handle cases where no movies match the search query by displaying a user-friendly message.
Responsive UI Design:

Use Tailwind CSS to design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
Ensure that the movie list and details view are easy to navigate on all devices.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for scenarios such as network issues, invalid API responses, or no search results.
Display clear error messages to the user when necessary.
