This is a Movie Database application capstone project built by Chukwunonso Kelvin Onwuka in partial fulfillment for the completion of the ALX frontend software development cohort 6 course.

This project has been built using React, Javascript and Tailwind CSS. The application will allow users to search for movies and view detailed information about them, using a public movie API.

This project will help me practice integrating external APIs, handling user input, managing state in a dynamic application, and creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

Features:
Fetches Movie Data:
It uses a public movie API (OMDB API) to fetch movie data based on user search queries.
Displays a list of movies matching the search criteria, showing key information such as:
Movie Poster: A thumbnail image of the movie poster.
Title: The title of the movie.
Release Date: The year the movie was released.

Movie Details View:
When a user clicks on a movie from the list, it displays a detailed view with additional information, including:
Plot Summary: A brief description of the movie plot.
Cast: Main actors.
Ratings: Ratings from different sources (e.g., IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes).
Genre: Categories the movie belongs to (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).

Search Functionality:
There is a search bar that allows users to type in a movie name and retrieve relevant search results.

Event Handling:
It handles cases where no movies match the search query by displaying a user-friendly message.

Responsive UI Design:
Uses Tailwind CSS to design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
Ensure that the movie list and details view are easy to navigate on all devices.

Error Handling:
It implement error handling for scenarios such as network issues, invalid API responses, or no search results and displays clear error messages to the user when necessary.
